						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-algorithm-introduction/" id="pis">Divide and Conquer</a><p>In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/" id="pis">Binary Search</a><p>Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/" id="pis">Merge Sort</a><p>Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation" id="pis">Asymtotic Notation</a><p>Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value. For example: In bubble sort, when the input array is already sorted, the time taken by the algorithm is linear i.e. the best case.</p>  
						</li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/" id="pis"> Backtracking</a><p>Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/" id="pis">N-Queen Problem</a><p>The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.</p> </li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/" id="pis">Greedy Algorithm</a><p>A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-1-jarviss-algorithm-or-wrapping/" id="pis">Convex Hull </a><p>A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all the given points. Input is an array of points specified by their x and y coordinates. The output is the convex hull of this set of points.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Huffman-Coding-Algorithm" id="pis">Huffman Coding Algorithm</a><p>n this algorithm, a variable-length code is assigned to input different characters. The code length is related to how frequently characters are used. Most frequent characters have the smallest codes and longer codes for least frequent characters.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/" id="pis">Knap Problem</a><p>Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamiltonian-cycle-backtracking-6/" id="pis">Hamiltonian Cycle</a><p> A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in the graph) from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then prints the path.</p></li>
						<li class="lis"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-set-1/" id="pis">Travelling Salesman Problem</a><p>Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.</p></li>
